Logisim circuit with truth table for a 1-bit full adder.  If we connect the carry out of the first bit to the carry in of the second, and so on, we now have a 4-bit ripply-carry adder.

To test the full adder, switches a0 and a1 are '1' (rightmost switches) as well as b2, which sums to 7.

When the carry in switch is flipped to a '1', the carry signal propogates and LED 3 is lit.
